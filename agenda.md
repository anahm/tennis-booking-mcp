- [ ] MCP tooling tips
    - Tool > agent
        - tools do the work. Prioritize tool quality > orchestration complexity
    - Use schemas
        - Zod schemas are valuable--says what's required, optional, + broken
    - Avoid tool soupüç≤
        - 1 tool per responsibility. 
        - Don't mix read + write || logic + UI
    - Don't blindly use tools

- [ ] MCP 🛠️ tips && takes
    - 🔨 > 🕵️‍♀️
        - 🔨 quality > orchestration complexity
    - Use schemas
        - Zod schemas = valuable (needed, ?, broken)
        - !just validation, but clarity
    - Avoid tool soup🍲 (!overload)
        - 1 tool per responsibility
        - !mix read + write || logic + UI
            - safer, testable, LLM can flexibly chain
    - !blindly use tools
        - 👀 [tool poisoning](https://x.com/lbeurerkellner/status/1907075048118059101?s=46)
    - MCP ⚒️ != API Wrappers
    - Design Tools⚒️ like you design endpoints
        - validate inputs, predict outputs
        - doc edge cases (ie "this tool might fail if site is down")
    - Descriptions should be boring
- [ ] In this project...
    - Debug in prod
    - Give tools⚒️ logs🪵. 
    - Keep DOM interaction as minimal as possible
    - Watch for layout shifts, button loads
    - headless browser != headless logic
        - !just controlling browser, automating judgment
        - retries, timeouts, fallbacks
- [ ] What's Next
    - auth
    - schedule (cron)
    - browser MCP tools = LLMs go from text prediction -> task completion
